pyposter
========

A simple usenet binary poster using python.

Just clone it and run pyposter.py. Should work fine on both Windows and Linux. Remember to edit pyposter.ini before using!

Requires Python 3 to run. And I don't support no legacy 32 bit systems.

- Requires cyenc https://github.com/meganomic/cyenc

Optional addons
- Par2cmdline for preprocessing functionality, http://chuchusoft.com/par2_tbb/
- Rar for preprocessing functionality, http://www.rarlab.com/
