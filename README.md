pyposter
========

A simple usenet binary poster using python.

Just clone it and run pyposter.py. Should work fine on both Windows and Linux. Remember to edit pyposter.ini before using!

Requires Python 3 to run.

- Requires par2cmdline for optional preprocessing functionality, http://chuchusoft.com/par2_tbb/
- Requires rar for optional preprocessing functionality, http://www.rarlab.com/

Yes I DO know about python yenc. But what's the fun in that?! Nothing, that's what.
