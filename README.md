pyposter
========

A simple usenet binary poster using python.

Requires Python 3 to run.

Just clone it and run pyposter.py. Should work fine on both Windows and Linux

Remember to edit pyposter.ini before using!

Also, don't use this. It contains hidden evil assumptions about input. If you aren't me you might break the internet.
Good luck, have fun if you give it a try anyway.

Requires par2cmdline for optional preprocessing functionality, http://chuchusoft.com/par2_tbb/
